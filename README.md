Monitor all those server temps with this easy device

## What is this?
This uses a 4-bit version of a basic LCD screen to display server temperatures. Using a .env file, you can load up all the credentials to grab temps from the system. You'll need to have `sensors` installed on the host for this to work. It also gets the weather (which, right now, is hard coded).
